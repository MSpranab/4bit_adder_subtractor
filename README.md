# Abstract
  The need to have hardware support for binary arithmetic is increasing in recent years because of the growth in the Binary data processing in 
  commercial, financial and internet based applications. In this paper you will go through A binary 4bit_Adder-Subtractor. 
  It is a combinational circuit which is capable of performing binary addition and subtraction in one circuitry. The operation mode can be selected using control signal.
  This circuit majorly required the prerequisite knowledge on XOR gate.
