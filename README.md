# Abstract
  In Digital Circuits, A binary 
Adder-Subtractor is a combinational circuit 
which is capable of performing binary 
addition and subtraction in one circuitry. The 
operation mode can be selected using 
control signal. This circuit majorly required 
the prerequisite knowledge on XOR gate.
